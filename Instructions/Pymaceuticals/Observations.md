Observation 1 - Based on the pie graphs the population timepoints observed fairly equally divided between male and female mice.  50.7% percent of the timepoints were from male mice and 49.3% were from female mice.  
Observation 2 - Looking at the summary statistics dataframes that I put together, there are two drugs that stand out from the pack when looking at mean and median tumor volume.  Capomulin and Ramicane both have values for these statistics that are significantly lower than the other drug regimens, suggesting that further investigation of these drugs is warranted to see if they are producing reducing tumor values.  
Observation 3 - The line graph that I produced shows a steady decline in tumor volume over time for the mouse I selected.  This suggests that this drug is possibly reducing the tumor size in this mouse.  It would be wise to check the other mice in this cohort to see if similar results were achieved.  
Observation 4 - The scatter plot produce a correlation value of .84 which shows there is a strong positive relationship between a mouse's weight and their average tumor volume.  This means that the bigger the mouse, the bigger the tumor.
